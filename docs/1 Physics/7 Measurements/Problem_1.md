# Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum

## Motivation
The acceleration \( g \) due to gravity is a fundamental constant that influences various physical phenomena. Measuring \( g \) accurately is important for understanding gravitational interactions, designing structures, and conducting experiments. A classic method for determining \( g \) involves measuring the oscillations of a simple pendulum, where the period of oscillation depends on the local gravitational field.

## Task
Measure the acceleration \( g \) due to gravity using a pendulum and analyze the uncertainties in the measurements. This exercise emphasizes precision, uncertainty analysis, and their role in experimental physics.

## Procedure

### 1. Materials
- A string (1 or 1.5 meters long).
- A small weight (e.g., a bag of coins, key chain, or sugar bag) attached to the string.
- Stopwatch (or smartphone timer).
- Ruler or measuring tape.

### 2. Setup
1. Attach the weight to the string and fix the other end to a sturdy support.
2. Measure the length of the pendulum, \( L \), from the suspension point to the center of the weight using a ruler or measuring tape. Record the resolution of the measuring tool and calculate the uncertainty as:
   \[
   \Delta L = \frac{\text{Ruler Resolution}}{2}
   \]

### 3. Data Collection
1. Displace the pendulum slightly (< 15\(^\circ\)) and release it.
2. Measure the time for 10 full oscillations (\( T_{10} \)) and repeat this process 10 times. Record all measurements.
3. Calculate the mean time for 10 oscillations (\( \overline{T}_{10} \)) and the standard deviation (\( \sigma_T \)).
4. Determine the uncertainty in the mean time using:
   \[
   \Delta T_{10} = \frac{\sigma_T}{\sqrt{n}}
   \]
   where \( n = 10 \).

## Calculations

### 1. Calculate the period
\[
T = \frac{\overline{T}_{10}}{10}, \quad \Delta T = \frac{\Delta T_{10}}{10}
\]

### 2. Determine \( g \)
\[
g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}
\]

### 3. Propagate uncertainties
\[
\Delta g = g \sqrt{\left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2}
\]

## Analysis

1. Compare your measured \( g \) with the standard value (9.81 m/sÂ²).
2. Discuss:
   - The effect of measurement resolution on \( \Delta L \).
   - Variability in timing and its impact on \( \Delta T \).
   - Any assumptions or experimental limitations.
